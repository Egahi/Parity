# Parity
Parity _"is the property of an integer of whether it is even or odd. An integer is even if it is a mulitple of two, and odd if it is not."_ - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parity_(mathematics))

This program prompts the user to enter a number. Then, it checks if the number is even or odd and prints out the appropriate message.

However, the program has some some syntatic and logical errors (bugs) and that's where you come in. You are to identify and fix the bugs to make the program work correctly.

## Objectives
- To practice identifying and fixing bugs in a simple C++ program.
- To gain familiarity with the syntax and structure of C++ programs.
- To develop critical thinking skills and problem-solving strategies for debugging code.

## Background
_"A software bug is an error, flaw or fault in the design, development, or operation of computer software that causes it to produce an incorrect or unexpected result, or to behave in unintended ways. The process of finding and correcting bugs is termed 'debugging' and often uses formal techniques or tools to pinpoint bugs"_ - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_bug)

In C++ the common types of erros you would encounter are Syntax, logical, semantic, linker and run-time errors. You can read more about them [here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/errors-in-cc/) For this challenge, we'll focus on syntax and logical errors.

Syntactic errors refer to mistakes in the grammar or syntax of C++ while logical errors, on the other hand, refer to mistakes in the algorithm or logic of the program.

## Pre-requisite Knowlege

## Getting Started
1. [Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) this repository to your github account.
2. [Clone](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo#cloning-your-forked-repository) it locally.
3. [Create and switch to a new branch](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-branch) in your local repo
4. Open the solution in [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)
4. Fix the bugs in [Parity.cpp](Parity\Parity.cpp)
5. [Commit your changes](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-commit) to the new branch
6. [Push](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-push) the new branch to your fork of the repo on github
6. [Create a pull request (pr)](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) to merge your changes in to the main branch.

## How to Test Your Code
The correct code should behave like these examples
